But after a children’s clothing designer is reborn as young Princess Blanche’s stepmom, she’s determined to break the mold and shower her daughter with love. Now she just has to convince the girl’s cold-hearted father to do the same. In her quest to make a happier home for Blanche, Abigail begins to uncover secrets and schemes within the palace.

Well if you still doubting I have to say that the story itself has a settings and plot that makes sense. A lot of things that happen in this story are justified and nothing happens for no reason. After the FL transmigrated into the original woman&#39;s body, things didn&#39;t magically change for her. The ML didn&#39;t just fall for her and until now some are still doubtful of the FL&#39;s drastic change which makes so much sense. The FL is smart, but she&#39;s not ruthless and scheming. Her thoughts are realistic and understandable. She knows when to push for her decisions and when to yield.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="An Image"></p><h2 id="characters" tabindex="-1">Characters <a class="header-anchor" href="#characters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characters&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Here are some of my thought about the characters.</p></blockquote><h3 id="blanche" tabindex="-1">Blanche <a class="header-anchor" href="#blanche" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blanche&quot;">​</a></h3><figure><img src="'+p+'" width="500" height="500"><figcaption style="font-style:italic;"> MC&#39;s stepdaughter, biological child of Sabelian and r*pist Miriam </figcaption></figure><p>This child is absolutely adorable.
